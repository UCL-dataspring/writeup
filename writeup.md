British Library/UCL Open Books for e-Research
=============================================

Summary
-------

RITS worked with digital scholarship experts and historians to use Legion to analyse a corpus of over sixty thousand digitised public domain books. Held by the British Library, the collection of books from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. Research questions such as "how often are different diseases mentioned" were answered. Analyses such as these would have taken over six days on a normal personal computer could be answered in under an hour on the UCL high-performance computing cluster, Legion. We built a framework to enable researchers to express complex textual analyses in simple python functions, and optimised the data layout to make best use of the parallel file system capabilities of Legion.
